    "You have a file that needs to be divided into `n` chunks. While it would be straightforward to split the file into equal-bytes sizes and then write those chunks to file, you cannot write any incomplete lines to the files. This means that all of the `n` files that you create must have **no truncated lines**. If a split of a certain byte-size would result in a truncated line, then you can back off and only write the previous complete line. You can save the rest of it for the next chunk.\n",
